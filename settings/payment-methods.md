# Billing

## Payment Methods

Currently, we accept Visa, MasterCard and American Express as payment methods within the Billing page. We do not accept certain cards due to cross-border restrictions as we are a Canadian corporation.

### Direct payment for EU-based users

Email us at support@lunchmoney.app if you don't have a credit card and would like to make a bank transfer to Lunch Money instead. Note that you may only do this for annual subscriptions.

### Using a payment method other than Visa, MC and AmEx

{% hint style="info" %}
Use this at your own risk. We do not officially endorse this method.
{% endhint %}

Use the Privacy app \([https://privacy.com/](https://privacy.com/)\) to generate a Visa-based credit card number for your unsupported credit card. This has been verified to work for Discover cards.

## Cancelations and Refunds

You can find the option to cancel your subscription and delete your account from the Billing page \(accessible via Settings\).

If you choose to cancel your subscription, your data will be purged and unrecoverable within 48 hours. 

A refund for unused time will only be issued if the credit is more than $3.00. It will take 5 to 7 business days for the refund to process before showing up in your account.
