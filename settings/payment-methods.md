# Payment Methods

Currently, we accept Visa, MasterCard and American Express as payment methods within the Billing page. We do not accept certain cards due to cross-border restrictions as we are a Canadian corporation.

### Direct payment for EU-based users

Email us at support@lunchmoney.app if you don't have a credit card and would like to make a bank transfer to Lunch Money instead. Note that you may only do this for annual subscriptions.

### Using a payment method other than Visa, MC and AmEx

{% hint style="info" %}
Use this at your own risk. We do not officially endorse this method.
{% endhint %}

Use the Privacy app \([https://privacy.com/](https://privacy.com/)\) to generate a Visa-based credit card number for your unsupported credit card. This has been verified to work for Discover cards.
