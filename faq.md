# FAQ

## Are there plans for a mobile app?

We don't currently have concrete in-house development plans for a mobile app. [Read more about why we're choosing to be web-first!](https://lunchmoney.app/features/web-first)

Lunch Money is maintained by a very small team, and right now, we're focused on staying lean, quick, and sustainable. Supporting mobile platforms will add a whole new level of complexity we're not ready to take on yet.

That being said, we are committed to continuously improving our [developer API ](https://developers.lunchmoney.app)which has enabled many Lunch Money users to create and share their own tools and companion apps with the larger community, such as:

* [Snack Change](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/snack-change/id1557614640), a live iOS companion app for Lunch Money
* [Milk Money](https://milkmoney.club/), a mobile website for quickly adding transactions by [dareiff](https://github.com/dareiff)
* [A scriptable iOS Widget](https://github.com/amanb014/lunch-money-widget) for transaction status updates by [amanb014](https://github.com/amanb014)

You can view a full list of tools and projects by the community [here](https://lunchmoney.dev/#awesome-projects).&#x20;

## How do I delete my account?

There are a few ways to initiate the complete deletion of your account and all its data from our servers.

First, there is a cancellation flow from the [Billing](https://my.lunchmoney.app/billing) page.&#x20;

Second, all accounts that are 5 days past their trial expiration dates which do not have any billing information associated will automatically be purged.

Lastly, you can email us directly at support@lunchmoney.app and we'll delete your account within 24 hours.
