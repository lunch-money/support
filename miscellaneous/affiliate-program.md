# Affiliate Program

The Lunch Money affiliate program will earn you 10% commission on recurring invoices for each referred user.&#x20;

## What's the difference between the Affiliate Program and the Referral Program?

The Affiliate Program and Referral Program are similar in that they provide the same rewards: a 10% commission on every referred user and 1 extra month of trial for the new user.

The two main differences between the Affiliate Program and the Referral Program are who can sign up and how the reward is paid out.

Anyone can sign up for the affiliate program, including people who are not Lunch Money users. Only Lunch Money users can refer users via the referral program and only paying subscribers will benefit from the rewards.

The Affiliate Program pays out rewards in monetary form via Paypal. However, rewards are paid out only after a minimum is reached (US$75). The Referral Program gives you a discount on your next invoice right away.

Individual paying subscribers who don't foresee having more than 10 referrals should stick with our referral program since you get the rewards right away. Folks, publications or businesses with a larger sphere of influence will benefit more from our Affiliate Program.
