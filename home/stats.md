# Stats

## View options

### Period Picker

Use the period picker to choose any time period for your statistics page. 

### Include recurring

Toggle this on to include recurring items in your statistics. You may want to turn off recurring items to get rid of repetitive data. For example, if your rent or mortgage payment is consistently the most expensive transaction, this may clutter your "Top Expensive Purchases" list. Removing recurring items from your data helps you better identify anomalies in your spending.

### Include 'exclude from totals'

Toggle this on to include transactions categorized as 'exclude from totals'. You may want to keep this off to exclude large transactions such as paying off credit card bills from your statistics.

## Elements
