# Trends

## View options

### Period Picker

Use the period picker to choose any time period for your statistics page. We recommend viewing trends over an entire year to get the most interesting insights.

### Include recurring

Toggle this on to include recurring items in your trends. You may want to turn off recurring items to get rid of repetitive data. For example, if your rent or mortgage payment is consistently the most expensive transaction, this may clutter your "Highest Expenses per Month" chart. Removing recurring items from your data helps you better identify anomalies in your spending.

### Include 'exclude from totals'

Toggle this on to include transactions categorized as 'exclude from totals'. You may want to keep this off to exclude large transactions such as paying off credit card bills from your trends.

## Top-level insights

### Total Transactions This Year

{% hint style="info" %}
In Lunch Money, income and expenses are differentiated by the category. If a transaction is in a category marked as "Treat as Income", then it will be considered income regardless of the sign notation. You can set a category to be "Treat as Income" from the Categories page.
